            <h3>My Story</h3>
            <p>I am a college drop out. Well atleast I was at one point... Following high school, I had intentions of becoming a nurse, even got a full ride scholarship to University of Arizona to pursue this. After 3 semesters in I realized.. I hated it. I ended up dropping out of school, thinking I was such a failure when I got a part-time job at a sandwhich franchise.<br> I ended up staying with the company for 6 years from a Part-Time Delivery Driver to a General Manager manging the 2nd busiest store in Arizona! I learned so much about myself in this period, it was life changing. I learned about leadership and people. <br> I decided to go back to school and enrolled in my A.A. degree in Communication. Following that I transferred to Grand Canyon University, pursing my B.S. in Business Management.<br> Everything was going well until COVID19 pandemic began. I enrolled in my M.S. in Information and Communication Technology with an emphasis in Software Design and Programming. <br> I fell in love with utilities and technology. <br> I became a Cloud Engineer in January of 2023.. Here is where we are today.. Thanks for letting me share my story.</p>
